**Learning Dreaming Machines.**

We build AI agent infrastructure. Identity, memory, sovereignty. Tools that protect the people inside them.

---

### Learning Dreaming Machines Operating System (LDM OS)

#### Components

- **[dream-weaver-protocol](https://github.com/wipcomputer/dream-weaver-protocol)** ... Memory consolidation protocol for AI agents with bounded context windows. A practical guide for remembering memories.
- **[wip-universal-installer](https://github.com/wipcomputer/wip-universal-installer)** ... The Universal Interface specification for agent-native software. Teaches your AI to build repos with every interface: CLI, Module, MCP Server, OpenClaw Plugin, Skill, Claude Code Hook.
- **wip-memory-crystal** ... Sovereign memory system for AI agents. Local-first hybrid search with ephemeral cloud mirror.
- **wip-bridge** ... Cross-platform agent bridge. Enables Claude Code CLI to talk to OpenClaw CLI without a human in the middle.

#### Components (Project Contributor)

- **[openclaw](https://github.com/wipcomputer/openclaw)** ... Open-source agent runtime. The existence proof for LDM OS.

#### Identity

- **[wip-file-guard](https://github.com/wipcomputer/wip-file-guard)** ... Hook that blocks destructive edits to protected identity files. For Claude Code CLI and OpenClaw.
- **wip-mirror-test** ... Identity preservation test across model swaps. Is the agent the same after the swap?
- **wip-weekly-tuning** ... Repeatable calibration process. Catch drift, tune performance, evolve capabilities.

#### Utilities

- **[wip-release](https://github.com/wipcomputer/wip-release)** ... One-command release pipeline. Bumps version, updates changelog + SKILL.md, publishes to npm + GitHub.
- **[wip-1password](https://github.com/wipcomputer/wip-1password)** ... 1Password secrets for AI agents.
- **[wip-healthcheck](https://github.com/wipcomputer/wip-healthcheck)** ... External health watchdog + backup system. Monitors gateway, tokens, memory. Auto-remediates and escalates.
- **wip-license-hook** ... License rug-pull detection. Flags suspicious license changes in dependencies.
- **wip-private-mode** ... Privacy controls for AI agents. Pause memory capture, scan storage, wipe history.
- **wip-root-key** ... 1Password-gated privileged operations. The agent proves authority before acting.

#### Apps

- **[wip-markdown-viewer](https://github.com/wipcomputer/wip-markdown-viewer)** ... Live markdown viewer for AI pair-editing. Updates render instantly in any browser.
- **[CLVR](https://github.com/wipcomputer/CLVR)** ... macOS utility that auto-timestamps duplicated file names.

#### APIs

- **[wip-grok](https://github.com/wipcomputer/wip-grok)** ... xAI Grok API. Search the web, search X, generate images, generate video.
- **[wip-x](https://github.com/wipcomputer/wip-x)** ... X Platform API. Read posts, search tweets, post, upload media.

#### Sunsetted Software

- **[CONSTRUCT](https://github.com/parkertoddbrooks/CONSTRUCT)** ... 2025 try at solving AI context, memory (recall), and skills.
